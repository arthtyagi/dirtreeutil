# dirutil
A Python utility to list your directory like a tree with formatting and options.

### How to use?

As of now, this is not a PyPi package installable with `pip` hence you need to :

* Clone the repo
* run `python3 dirutil.py -d <PATH>`

This is **mainly** intended for visualizing directories with clean strucutres or less files as are most other tree utilities.
