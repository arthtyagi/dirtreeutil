        # dirutil
        A Python utility to list your directory like a tree with formatting and options.
        
        ### How to use?
        
        As of now, this is not a PyPi package installable with `pip` hence you need to :
        
        * Clone the repo
        * run `python3 dirutil.py -d <PATH>`
        
        This is **mainly** intended for visualizing directories with clean strucutres or less files as are most other tree utilities.
